# Life-expectancy-Prediction
I worked on the data of W.H.O. to make a machine learning model to predict the life expectancy of the country.
I tried regressions like xgboost, linear regression, polynomial regression and random forest, and random forest gives the best results.
This model can predict life expectancy accuratly up to 90%.
Also pointed out the factors which are affecting the life expectancy most.
